Once upon a time, in a neutral city called Dale, lived a demacian
wizard and a legion of warriors escaped from the great war fought
between Noxus and Demacia.

After few years, Demacia won the war and extended his domain
to its neighboring countries. When demacian generals conquered
Dale they found their wizard and their deserters soldiers.

It did not take long for the generals to identify their people
and arrest them. As punishment they have been put, together
with noxus war prisoners, into a two dimensional world by
the demacian first wizard.

But demacians made only one mistake: Isaac, the deserter wizard
was sick, but togheter with his accomplices.

For a long time demacian traitors tried to fight against noxus
prisoners in order to gain medicines and magical essence
for Isaac.
Unfortunately almost everyone died in the fights, but there is
one last warrior standing who gained enough medicines from
the enemies and healed the wizard.

Now Isaac is almost physically fit and has enough magic power
to revive the warrior, but needs few more  medicines and
magical essence to cast the spell that will free them both
from that horrible two dimensional world...
